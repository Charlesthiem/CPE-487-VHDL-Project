# CPE-487-VHDL-Project
Digital System Design Project

Hey guys,

I created an "UpDownCounter" Project in the ISE and copied the entire directory into this repository, that's the "UpDownCounter" folder in the repository. If you open the folder, you should see a "UDCounterModule.vhd" file - that's the vhdl file for the Up/Down Counter and I'm pretty sure that's the only file we'll ever need to edit.

Github doesn't make it easy to download individual files, but you can download the entire repository as a zip file by opening the repository (https://github.com/aalvare3/CPE-487-VHDL-Project), clicking the green "Clone or download" button, and clicking "Download ZIP". Go ahead and download it if you wanna work on the project offline. Feel free to edit the .vhd file in Github but if you make any changes offline to it, please save it to the "UpDownCounter" directory in Github as a separate file from "UDCounterModule.vhd" so we can keep track of all the changes we make.

I also added the project description and data sheet to the repository for convenience.
